This is a nextjs fullstack project, where user can share and create AI prompt among the users. The project has been completed following the youtube tutorial by JavaScript Mastery (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk&t=9520s). However, there are many features that I build myself to complete the project. The features includes: 
- Implement Search [by promt, by tag, by username]
- Implement click by tag
- Implement other user's profile view
- Implement Like button with persistance
  
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
